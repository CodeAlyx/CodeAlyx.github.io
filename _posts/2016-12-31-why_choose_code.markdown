My first coding experience was, as with many people my age I'm sure, customizing myspace pages. While my grasp on even the simpler concepts of coding was very much lacking back then, I still got a good kick out of fiddling with the HTML code. It wasn't until later in my high school days that I was officially introduced to coding in the form of basic C++ and HTML and I loved it. I didn't really know why I enjoyed it so much at the time, all I really did know then was that it was the first subject that I founded entertaining after I grasped it. In later years, after many interesting and sometimes unfortunate life experiences, I began to better understand myself and the world around me. That is when I realized why I had to make code my life. It satisfies my creative and logical needs at the same time as very few other hobbies do. So I decided to make a life of it. What more could one want than spending their days with passion and love for something?
