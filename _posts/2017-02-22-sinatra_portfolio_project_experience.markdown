I had some difficulty coming up with a topic for the sinatra portfolio project. After a while I decided to go with just a general forum set up. I still want to change the design and concept a bit as well as do some refactoring and make the code at least somewhat more... smooth. I know there were a couple of things I could have abstracted away but I do have a personal deadline for all of this afterall. I did have a lot of fun at the beginning, setting up the initial file structure, environment, and everything else. I really enjoyed throwing in a few dynamic links on the index and show pages as well. I do feel my code is a little ugly but, honestly, my biggest concern with this project was producing proper functionality. I did, however, wind up neglecting the set up of a proper rspec ladder. I started to put together some rspec tests but quickly found myself debugging my tests more than my code and decided it was more efficient (and fun) for me to test my code through various other means (rake console, pry sessions, tux, and such). In the end, it still leaves easy room for improvement but it does work. For a project that I don't expect to ever be published for any actual use, that's good enough for me. I had an experience and learned a few things along the way. I even found a few things that currently evade me and an answer to which shall be subsequently pursued. All is fun, in the end.
