When I first started on the Ruby Gem project, I was somewhat over excited. My mind was racing with potential functionality over the following days. It was especially nice to just kind of be pushed in, on my own for the project. No detailed guidline for what to make, full freedom to really test myself. While I know there is still a fair bit of cleaning up I can do on my code, I have to say that I'm fairly proud of myself. Its always nice to see progress in one's endeavors.
